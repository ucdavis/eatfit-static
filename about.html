        <h3>On-line Eating Analysis</h3>
        <p>Want an interactive, individualized approach to improving your students' eating habits? Some way that you can target each student at a personal level while teaching them math and computer skills at the same time? And know that it is effective? Look no further. Just click on the Eating Analysis link on the left to try it out for yourself.</p>
        <p>This on-line application starts with the entry of a 24-hour diet record by the student, and concludes with the output of a behaviorally focused goal. The Eating Analysis will provide feedback on six main areas: calcium, iron, fruits and vegetables, added sugar, fat, and habits. Students can choose from the two areas that need the most improvement and then choose a specific goal to work towards. Results have shown great success.</p>
        <h3>Teacher Curriculum</h3>
        <p>This nine-lesson curriculum provides hands-on activities that teach students the skills they need to meet their goals. It is behaviorally focused and thus includes activities that help students to gain the insight and awareness required to change thier current food related behaviors.
