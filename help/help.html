<h2>Welcome to Eating Analysis</h2>
<p> Why are you doing this? To find out how your eating choices are going. When you eat, you have two choices: 1) to shove anything tasty in your mouth, or 2) to put something tasty and fit in your mouth. To get from step 1 to step 2, you need to find out what foods will help you to get fit. So by giving me all the foods you choose to eat on a day, I can look it over, and see what you could change in the future. Nothing major- an orange juice here, a piece of jerky there, and presto! You're at step 2. Didn't even hurt, did it?</p>
<a name="works"></a>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>First you supply some basic information: name, age, and gender, and select what is most important to you. Your choices are</p>

<ul>
<li>Gain strength</li>
<li>Lose weight </li>
<li>Get fit </li>
<li>Improve appearance </li>
<li>Increase energy </li>
<li>Stabilize mood </li>
<li>Improve school performance</li>
<li>Improve athletic performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Next you enter all the foods you ate for a day (one at a time, of course), then I look at their nutrient values and tell you where you did the best and where you might want to strive to improve. You will have two choices for the area of improvement which we call goals. Once you select the area for improvement, you will have some choices of for a minor goal. The minor goal you select becomes your Eating Contract. You can print the eating contract and have it witnessed by a friend or parent.</p>
<a name="enter"></a>
<h2>Entering Foods You Ate</h2>
<p>There are 4 easy steps to enter a food. You just repeat them until you have entered all the food you ate for the day. Your day may start anytime and run for 24 hours to that time the next day.</p>
<a name="habits"></a>
<h2>Eating Habits</h2>
<p>There are 3 multiple choice and 2 true/false questions about your eating habits. Answer each one and click on the Click Here! button to continue. Then you will see your Eating Analysis.</p>
<a name="analysis"></a>
<h2>Eating Analysis</h2>
<p>Your Eating Analysis is based on the foods you ate and your answers to the Eating Habits questions. The first part describes the area where you did best. The two areas where you most need to strive for improvement are identified. You will have two choices for the area of improvement which we call goals. Once you select the area you want to concentrate on for the next several weeks and click Next>>. You will have some choices of for a minor goal. The minor goal you select becomes your Eating Contract. You can print the eating contract and have it witnessed by a friend or parent.</p>
<a name="print"></a>
<h2>How to Print your report</h2>
<p>Your Eating Contract is available as an Acrobat© Reader© PDF file and as a Microsoft Word document. Other choices may be available as well. Select your choice to have the Eating Contract sent to your printer. If you don't have the software for any of the available formats on your computer, consider installing the Adobe Reader. It's free!
