    <p><strong>Graduate student research fellowship</strong>
    <br>The Olive Center relies heavily on graduate students to conduct boundary-pushing research on olive production, processing or evaluation.  We carefully select graduates with high academic standing, a strong work ethic, and a commitment to pursuing innovation.  $25,000 would fund a half-time graduate student for one year, while $50,000 would fund a full-time graduate student for one year, with the required university fees included.</p>
